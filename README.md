# 🎮 Bouncing Ball Game (Python + Pygame)

A fun and progressively challenging **Bouncing Ball Game** developed using **Python and Pygame**. The goal is simple: **guide the ball to the green goal while avoiding obstacles**, collecting power-ups, and surviving through increasing difficulty levels. This repository also represents my **learning journey**, from writing a simple Python game to handling real-world packaging and OS compatibility challenges.

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

### ✅ Option 1: Run Using the Executable (Recommended)

If you face Python or library issues, use the pre-built executable:

1. Go to the `dist/` folder
2. Run:
```text
   BouncingBall.exe
```

✔ No Python installation required  
✔ Best option for Windows users

---

### 🐍 Option 2: Run Using Python Source Code

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pygame library

#### Install Pygame
```bash
pip install pygame
```

#### Run the Game
```bash
python BouncingBall.py
```

⚠️ **Note:** If you encounter library or compatibility errors on Windows, use the EXE file instead.

## 📖 Project Story & Learning Experience

This project is more than just a game. This article shares the full experience—from building a simple Python game, learning about packaging with tools like Buildozer, to eventually installing Ubuntu over Windows to overcome compatibility issues.

### Key Lessons Learned:

- Python game development using Pygame
- Handling collisions & physics
- Designing game states and UI screens
- Packaging Python apps using PyInstaller
- Understanding platform compatibility problems
- Exploring Linux (Ubuntu) as a better development environment

What started as a small experiment turned into a hands-on learning journey across software development, packaging, and operating systems.
